Candy Crush Saga is a hit mobile game developed by King (part of Activision|Blizzard) that is played by millions of people all around the world.

In this Project, you will get to work with a real Candy Crush dataset and use this data to estimate level difficulty. This Project assumes you can manipulate data frames using dplyr and make plots using ggplot2.

This project uses data from anonymous players playing one "episode" of the game, in the year 2014.

In this notebook, I will be using the following packages: 
1. readr
2. dplyr
3. ggplot2
